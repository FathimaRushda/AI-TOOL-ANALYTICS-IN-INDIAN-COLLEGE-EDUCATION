# AI-TOOL-ANALYTICS-IN-INDIAN-COLLEGE-EDUCATION
A multi-tool analysis of AI tool adoption among Indian college students, exploring usage patterns, academic impact, and trust factors using Python, R, and Tableau.
---

## Overview
This project analyzes how AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini are becoming an integral part of academic life for Indian college students. It explores usage patterns, trust, awareness, and academic impact across different streams, internet access levels, and regions. The study highlights how students engage with AI, how these tools influence learning, and what factors drive adoption. By combining behavioral and academic insights, the project provides valuable guidance for educators and edtech providers to enable responsible AI integration in higher education.

## Objectives
- Analyze AI tool adoption patterns among Indian college students.  
- Identify relationships between usage hours, internet access, and academic performance.  
- Compare AI tool preferences across academic streams (Engineering, Science, Commerce, Arts).  
- Assess trust levels and willingness to pay for AI tools.  
- Validate insights using statistical hypothesis tests (T-test, Z-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, F-test).  
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for educators.

## Key Insights
- **Top AI tools**: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot  
- **Science, Commerce, and Arts** students used AI more than Engineering students  
- **Copilot** was the most trusted tool, while **Claude** had the lowest trust ratings  
- **First-year students** reported more negative impacts; **final-year students** showed positive outcomes  
- Students with **medium-quality internet access** had the highest daily usage  
- **Maharashtra** recorded the highest AI adoption and awareness levels  
- **Willingness to pay** was evenly split — about half yes, half no  
- **Laptops** were the most common device used to access AI tools

## Tools & Technologies
* Python – Data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
* R Programming – Hypothesis testing (t.test, aov, chisq.test, Z-test, F-test)  
* Tableau – Interactive dashboards & KPI visualization

## Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard includes:
- **KPI cards** – total states covered, internet access levels, average daily usage hours, academic streams, and the most preferred AI tool  
- **Filters** – explore insights by Stream and Year of Study  
- **State-wise awareness map** – showing how AI familiarity varies across regions  
- **AI usage by year of study** – track engagement changes from first to final year  
- **Internet access and AI usage** – compare how connectivity impacts adoption  
- **Preferred AI tools distribution** – identify the most popular platforms among students
